## Introduction

This information extends the [W3C Mission](https://www.w3.org/mission/) (vision, identity, design principles, strategic goals) to address accessibility specifics.

Background: W3C re-launched as a public-interest non-profit organization in 2023 with accessibility as a clear priority in W3C's mission. [[press release](https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2023/w3c-le-launched/)] Accessibility is woven throughout the fabric of W3C and we will continue with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) focus.

The purposes for developing this include:
* Define and document W3C's commitment to accessibility.
* Encourage W3C Members, potential contributors, and others to support accessibility work through W3C.
* Direct limited staff (chair, facilitator, participant, contributor) resources to agreed-upon priorities.

## Mission

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the web accessible to people with disabilities.

## Vision

The W3C vision is that the Web and related technologies are accessible so that people with disabilities around the globe can **participate equally** in the digital world. That includes:
* Accessibility standards/guidelines are harmonized globally.
* All technical standards and specifications support accessibility.
* Tools that create and deliver digital content support accessibility.
* Everyone who creates or manages digital products has relevant accessibility knowledge.
* New technologies, digital products, and content addresses accessibility from inception (“born accessible”).

## High-Level Objectives

To contribute to realizing the vision, W3C addresses the following areas:

1. **Specifications, standards, and technologies support accessibility:**
   - Ensure that W3C specifications support accessibility.
   - Provide guidance on accessibility in other specifications and technologies.

2. **International accessibility standards:**
   - Facilitate international multi-stakeholder development and communication so the standards can be adopted and implemented internationally.
   - Develop technical specifications to support accessibility, such as [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) and accessibility API mappings.
   - Develop accessibility standards/guidelines for relevant tools and content.
   - Provide guidance beyond what can be included in these standards, such as [WCAG Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/about/).
   
3. **Support understanding, adopting, and implementing accessibility:**
   - Facilitate and promote translations of W3C accessibility standards and supporting resources.
   - Provide documentation on understanding and implementing accessibility standards.
   - Provide awareness and education resources, such as many listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/).

4. **Accessibility research**:
   - Encourage effective international research to provide a solid basis for accessibility standards.
   - Conduct horizon scanning.

## [draft] 2024 Priorities and Specific Objectives

To focus limited resources on top priorities, W3C WAI staff will focus on the following objectives in 2024, in addition to supporting standards development, key Working Group deliverables, and internal W3C projects.

- Support standards harmonization, including WCAG 2.2 and ISO.
- [W3Cx accessibility courses](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/) - revise and update into two courses.
- [Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/) - solicit, support, and promote translations of W3C accessibility resources, with the goal of: [@@ specific targets...]
- Define a plan for better addressing digital accessibility in the Global South.
- Improve guidance for contributors (group participants and public). Improve under-represented stakeholder engagement along with W3C-wide efforts.
- Develop better pathways through W3C accessibility information, particularly for people who are new to accessibility.
- Provide updated guidance on mobile accessibility, including consideration of important issues in the Global South.

_[draft note: will make these more specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)]_
