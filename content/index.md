## Introduction

This information extends the [W3C Mission](https://www.w3.org/mission/) (vision, identity, design principles, strategic goals) to address accessibility specifics.

Background: W3C re-launched as a public-interest non-profit organization in 2023 with accessibility as a clear priority in W3C's mission. [[press release](https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2023/w3c-le-launched/)] Accessibility is woven throughout the fabric of W3C and we will continue with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) focus.

The purposes for developing this include:
* Define and document W3C's commitment to accessibility.
* Encourage W3C Members, potential contributors, and others to support accessibility work through W3C.
* Direct limited staff resources to agreed-upon priorities.

## Accessibility Vision

The W3C vision is that the Web and related technologies are accessible so that people with disabilities around the globe can **participate equally** in the digital world. That includes:
* All **technical standards** and specifications support accessibility.
* Accessibility standards/guidelines are **harmonized globally**.
* **Browsers** and other user tools support accessibility.
* Content **authoring tools** support accessibility.
* Developers, designers, project managers, and others have solid **basic accessibility knowledge**.
* Accessibility is **integrated** in education and training, {@@other things that WAI materials support...}, etc.
* New technologies, new digital products, and new content addresses accessibility from the very beginning of inception and throughout design and development (“**born accessible**”).

## Mission

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the web accessible to people with disabilities. 

## Objectives

_**Editors' Note:** Links to GitHub Discussions are temporary and won't be in the final version of this page._

To contribute to realizing the vision, W3C addresses the following areas:

1. **Specifications, standards, and technologies support accessibility:**
   - Ensure that W3C specifications support accessibility. Provide guidance on accessibility considerations from the inception of new work, throughout development, and before final approval.
   - Provide guidance on accessibility considerations in other relevant specifications and technologies. (For example, [Media Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/) provided guidance for HTML5.)
   - Provide guidance through the Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies [(FAST](https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/)).

2. **International accessibility standards:**
   - Facilitate international multi-stakeholder development so the standards can be adopted and implemented internationally. _-- see [Standards harmonization internationally (GitHub discussion)](https://github.com/w3c/wai-mission/discussions/16)_
   - Develop technical specifications to support accessibility, including [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) and accessibility API mappings.
   - _? open question: scope of web, digital -- see [Scope of W3C web, digital accessibility work (GitHub discussion)](https://github.com/w3c/wai-mission/discussions/4)_
   - _? open questions: ? content, user agents, authoring tools, EPUB, mobile apps, other? (see Discussions in GitHub on [mobile apps](https://github.com/w3c/wai-mission/discussions/7),  [browsers](https://github.com/w3c/wai-mission/discussions/5),  [authoring tools](https://github.com/w3c/wai-mission/discussions/6))_
   - Provide relevant guidance beyond what can be included in these standards, such as [WCAG Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/about/).

3. **Support understanding, adopting, and implementing accessibility:**
   - Encourage international standards harmonization (e.g., adoption of WCAG as is). _(see [Standards Harmonization (GitHub discussion)](https://github.com/w3c/wai-mission/discussions/11))_
   - Facilitate and promote translations of W3C accessibility standards and supporting resources.
   - Provide documentation on understanding and implementing accessibility standards (e.g., [WCAG Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/about), [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), [Making Audio and Video Media Accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/), [Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/)).
   - Provide awareness and education resources, such as many listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/).
   - Maintain updated [Digital Accessibility Foundations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/) / Introduction to Web Accessibility course.
   - Support improved accessibility evaluation processes and tools (e.g., with [ACT Rules](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/)).

4. **Accessibility research**:
   - Encourage effective international research to provide a solid basis for accessibility standards.
   - Analyze research findings to inform accessibility standards (for example, [Digital Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/research/user-requirements/)).
   - Conduct horizon scanning.

5. **Support W3C mission:**
   - Support increased involvement of under-represented stakeholders, including people with specific disabilities and people in low resource regions.
   - Ensure accessibility of W3C website, tools, presentations, etc.

## 2023 Q3-Q4 WAI Staff Priorities

_2023 priorities are based on existing key activities, work commitments, and resources._

Support continued development of key Working Group activities, including WCAG 2.2 support materials, WCAG2ICT, WCAG 3 exploration of conformance models, ARIA, etc. Provide on-going technical advice on WCAG 2.2 and WCAG2ICT updates for EN 301 549.<br>Current work is introduced in [What We're Working On: Accessibility Activities and Publications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/update/).

2. Define priorities and strategic plan
   - Define vision, mission, strategic plan, communications plan, and specific objectives for 2024-2025 and beyond. (We will revisit and refine in as useful.)
   - Work on getting additional resources to cover needs and priorities. (At least 1 new position is approved and will be posted ASAP, hopefully in September.)

3. Complete specific projects by February 2024:
   - Update [Policies List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) and [Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/)
   - Publish and promote [AI Accessibility research symposium report](https://deploy-preview-193--wai-about-wai.netlify.app/about/projects/wai-coop/symposium2/) and recordings
   - Publish new version of [Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
   - Update [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/) with videos
   - Translations – facilitate Authorized Translations of WCAG 2.2, manage updating [existing accessibility resource translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/), facilitate additional translations, improve process for WAI translations

4. Progress WAI website re-architecture project to provide more stability and easier maintenance. Expected completion is 2024 Q2.
