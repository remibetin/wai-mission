## Introduction

This information extends the [W3C Mission](https://www.w3.org/mission/) (vision, identity, design principles, strategic goals) to address accessibility specifics.

Background: W3C re-launched as a public-interest non-profit organization in 2023 with accessibility as a clear priority in W3C's mission. [[press release](https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2023/w3c-le-launched/)] Accessibility is woven throughout the fabric of W3C and we will continue with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) focus.

The purposes for developing this include:
* Define and document W3C's commitment to accessibility.
* Encourage W3C Members, potential contributors, and others to support accessibility work through W3C.
* Direct limited staff resources to agreed-upon priorities.

## Accessibility Vision

The W3C vision is that the Web and related technologies are accessible so that people with disabilities around the world can participate equally in the digital world. That includes:
* All **technical standards** and specifications support accessibility.
* Accessibility standards/guidelines are **harmonized globally**.
* **Browsers** and other user tools support accessibility.
* Content **authoring tools** support accessibility.
* Developers, designers, project managers, and others have solid **basic accessibility knowledge**.
* Accessibility is **integrated** in education and training, {@@other things that WAI materials support...}, etc.
* New technologies, new digital products, and new content address accessibility from the very beginning of inception and throughout design and development (“**born accessible**”).

## Accessibility Mission

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the web accessible to people with disabilities. 

## Accessibility Objectives

To contribute to realizing the vision, W3C addresses the following areas:

1. **Specifications, standards, and technologies support accessibility:**
   - Ensure that W3C specifications support accessibility. Provide guidance on accessibility considerations from the inception of new work, throughout development, and before final approval.
   - Provide guidance on accessibility considerations in relevant specifications and technologies outside of W3C, e.g., HTML5.
   - Develop Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies [(FAST](https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/))

2. **International accessibility standards:**
   - Facilitate international multi-stakeholder development so the standards can be adopted and implemented internationally.
   - ? web, digital, non-web ICT _(see for discussion:_ [_Scope of web, digital, non-web ICT_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI9cIjQYonGfKNHvB2rFhpwmW06QEl2r0xBObkHOWZs/edit#heading=h.r1tq3h1yst32) _for discussion)_
   - ? content, user agents, authoring tools, other? _(see_ [_User agents and authoring tools_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI9cIjQYonGfKNHvB2rFhpwmW06QEl2r0xBObkHOWZs/edit#heading=h.1nvz99i27u4h) _for discussion)_
   - ARIA, API mappings, EPUB accessibility
   - ? priority of WAI-Adapt, spoken pronunciation, other
   - Provide guidance beyond standards, such as [WCAG Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/about/).

3. **Support understanding, adopting, and implementing accessibility:**
   - Encourage international standards harmonization (e.g., adoption of WCAG as is).  _(see_ [_Standards harmonization_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI9cIjQYonGfKNHvB2rFhpwmW06QEl2r0xBObkHOWZs/edit#heading=h.ovk0n0kijjq5) _for discussion)_
   - Facilitate and promote translations of W3C accessibility standards and supporting resources.
   - Provide documentation on understanding and implementing accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG Techniques, ARIA Authoring Practices Guide, Tutorials).
   - Provide applied education resources, such as many listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/)
   - Maintain updated [Digital Accessibility Foundations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/) / Introduction to Web Accessibility course.
   - Support improved accessibility evaluation processes and tools (e.g., with ACT Rules).

4. **Accessibility research**:
   - Encourage effective international research to provide a solid basis for accessibility standards.
   - Document meta-analysis of multiple studies. 
   - Conduct horizon scanning.

5. **Support W3C mission:**
   - Support increased involvement of under-represented stakeholders, including people with specific disabilities and people in low resource regions.
   - Support W3C Member participation.
   - Ensure accessibility of W3C website, tools, presentations, etc.

## 2023 WAI Priorities

_2023 priorities are based on existing key activities, work commitments, and resources._

1. Priorities and strategic plan

   - Define vision, mission, strategic plan, communications plan, and priorities for 2024 and beyond. (We will revisit and refine in 2024 as useful.)
   - Work on getting additional resources to cover needs and priorities. (At least 1 new position is approved and will be posted ASAP, hopefully in September.)

2. Support continued development of key Working Group activities, including WCAG 2.2 support materials, WCAG 3 exploration of conformance models, ARIA, etc. Provide on-going technical advice on WCAG 2.2 and WCAG2ICT updates to EN 301 549.

3. Complete committed projects by February 2024:

   - Update [Policies List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) and [Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/)
   - Publish and promote [AI Accessibility research symposium report](https://deploy-preview-193--wai-about-wai.netlify.app/about/projects/wai-coop/symposium2/) and recordings
   - Publish new version of [Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
   - Update [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/) with videos
   - Translations – facilitate Authorized Translations of WCAG 2.2, manage updating [existing accessibility resource translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/), facilitate additional translations, improve process for WAI translations

4. WAI website re-architecture project to provide more stability and easier maintenance. Expected completion is 2024 Q2.

5. Update W3C's [Digital Accessibility Foundations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/) / Introduction to Web Accessibility course. Expected completion is 2024 Q2.

## Priorities and Strategic Plan for 2024 and Beyond

_… To be developed as objectives and priorities are further defined, including based on the @@ discussion points. …_
